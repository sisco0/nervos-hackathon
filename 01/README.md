# The Nervos Hackathon!

I am happy that I could contribute to _Nervos Hackathon_ by solving the tasks shown. This task represents the first task for getting into the Nervos ecosystem.

First of all, I had to get ckb-cli and godwoken-example (with the given branch stated in the documentation) repositories. After that, I had to go to ckb-cli and create a new account, which has a mainnet and a testnet address

After creating these new shiny wallets, I had to go to https://faucet.nervos.org/ to drop some balance into the testnet wallet. The testnet wallet balance and the details of the bonus transaction could be seen in the following URL:

Then, I exported my private key by using ckb-cli as well.
 
After that, I got into the godwoken-examples, where I downloaded the advised dataset; I used aria2c to speed up the download process by using ten connections instead of only one (l33ch3r mode). Then, I created a new Ethereum wallet using Metamask and transferred the balance from my Nervo wallet into my new Metamask Ethereum wallet.

Everything went as expected and I am ready to go on with the second challenge.
